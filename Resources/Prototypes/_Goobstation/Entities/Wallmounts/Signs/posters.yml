  description: "A poster reminding you of the 'optimal' time for Nanotrasen-approved smoke breaks. They considered it long enough due to a security officer that alledgedly consumed about 65 cigarettes in 65 minutes. It has been shoddily edited to account for its recent increase by 65 minutes, as requested near-unanimously by the Station Captains who were polled. The color of the background is mildly irritating, but you're not too sure why."
