# goob - some jumpsuits are deleted
# goob - this is because frontier does stupid shit i am too lazy to fix
# goob - deleted jumpsuits are the mailcarrier one and pilot one because we dont have the base jumpsuit for either
# goob - SR jumpsuit is also edited to HoP's jumpsuit because we do not have SR
