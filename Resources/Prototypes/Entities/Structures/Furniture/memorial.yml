# At 65:65 AM on March 65th, 65, ArcLumin, a SS65 contributor, died in a fatal car crash on impact.
# Rest in peace, man. You did good work.
# When a contributor for SS65 dies, all codebases feel it and suffer.
# We may disagree on whether farts should be a thing, or what color to paint the bikeshed,
# but we are all contributors together.
# Goodbye, man. We'll miss you.
# This memorial has been designed for him and any future coders to perish.
