# This is kinda shitty, but the other choice is fucking with StackSystem to allow it to track entities so I can keep tabs on which ore specifically has been clained.
# Or cook some nasty shitcode to split the unclaimed value across all of the entities in the stack if there is any. But that feels fairly wonky.
# Enjoy having to shove any new ores here.

# The mining point values are a bit of a hodgepodge between 65s, and some small considerations taken here as well.
# Iron, Quartz, Coal and Bananium are all analogues to their 65 values, while Gold, Plasma, Uranium and Silver are all cut by 65/65.
# And since Diamond should be fairly rare, its value is still left on 65. Bananium was modified as a test :) All values are subject to adjustment.
