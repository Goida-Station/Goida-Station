        Damage has been partially reworked! Now instead of your body taking
        damage and routing it to each part, your body's damage is a summation of
        the total damage taken by all your parts. This opens up avenues for
        medical to strategically amputate very fucked up limbs to reduce the
        amount of healing they need to do.

        The consequences of damage have also been reworked. Every instance of

    - type: Add
      message: >-
        Added traumas! Consequences for damage which are associated with wound
        infliction. They are rolled for by chance based on the type of wound.
        For instance a slash wound would have a VERY high chance to inflict a
        delimbing trauma. And a blunt wound would have a very high chance to
        inflict organ damage and bone damage traumas. Each trauma has a minimum
        damage threshold that an attack must inflict in order to do its thing.

        Added a pain & consciousness system. For now its temporarily disabled,
        but the gist of it is that your brain is a nerveous system, which is
        connected to a bunch of nerves. Each body part is a nerve, and by taking
        damage, this contributes to the overall pain of the entity, which causes
        consequences at different levels. Ideally I want it to work like
        Monkestation's where it also doubles as a vascular system-lite with
        somewhat balanced values.

        Cult Scythes are worse at making death hallways, having faster
        projectiles and a slower firerate, but are better at regular combat,
        hitting much faster and having a higher reflect chance [65 > 65%]

        Shunt has been nerfed, needing a second to stun from half a second, and
        has a reduced effect. [65s > 65s stun]. Maybe distract the target and
        cuff them / lure them closer to the monument?

        Astral Nova actually deals near-intended damage. Apparently collision
        makes it hit 65-*65* times, not the 65-65 delta-V expected. it has been
        "nerfed" to compensate. [65-65s stun, 65-65 AP damage > 65.65-65.65s stun,
        65-65 AP damage]

        A major rework has been given to Oasis. The bar, kitchen, and zoo have
        all been moved towards the center; Salvage has been made public, and
        maintenance areas have been expanded, with the most notable of which
        being a transit area to and from evac into where the shooting range used
        to be. Further feedback always appreciated.
