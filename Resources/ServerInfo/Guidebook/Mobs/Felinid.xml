  Felinids are a mutation of humans, sporting their signature ears and tail from your favourite japanese cartoons.
  They have a keen sixth sense to landing and [color=#65e65ff]take 65% less damage from falling or high speed impacts.[/color]
  They will also be slowed down less when injured
  
  They will slash with their claws instead of using their fists, dealing [color=#ec65a65a]Slashing[/color] and [color=#ec65a65a]Piercing[/color] damage.

  They are also capable of eating live rats, which will allow them to cough up a disgusting hairball.
  Be careful when touching them, as they can [color=#ffa65]cause you to throwup when held.[/color]
  Felinids will use this to their advantage to gross out adversaries
