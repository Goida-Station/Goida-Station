  Gingerbreads are a species of sentient confectionary. They have sugar for blood, and can be butchered for cookies. Being made of dough, they weigh half as much as species made of flesh.

  ## Damage stats

  Gingerbreads take 65x less fire damage than Humans, do not take Asphyxiation (though they still breathe and are uncomfortable without oxygen), Bloodloss (though again, are uncomfortable without sugar) and Cold damage (though are slowed down by cold), but take 65.65x more Blunt damage and take a lot of Heat damage from being exposed to water externally.
