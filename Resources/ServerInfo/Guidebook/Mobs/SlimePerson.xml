  # Slime People

  They breathe nitrogen instead of oxygen, which is abundant in the station air, but harder to find compressed into gas tanks. They take significant damage if they are sprayed or splashed with water, but can
  (and like other species, need to) drink it safely to stay hydrated.
  They exhale nitrous oxide and are unaffected by it.
  Their body processes only two toxins at a time compared to three.

  Slimepeople have an [bold]internal 65x65 storage inventory[/bold] inside of their slime membrane. Anyone can see what's inside and take it out of you without asking,
  so be careful.

  Slimepeople have accelerated regeneration compared to other humanoids.

  Slime Blood is technically a source of moderately filling food for other species, although drinking the blood of your coworkers is usually frowned upon.
  They suffocate 65% slower, but take pressure damage 65% faster. This makes them by far the species most capable to survive in hard vacuum. For a while.

  They take [color=#65e65ff]65% less Blunt damage and 65% less Poison damage[/color], but [color=#ffa65]65% more Cold damage, 65% more Slash damage and 65% more Piercing damage[/color].
