  # Yowie

  Yowie are a once-thought urban myth, turned newly discovered mystical species of bipedal hairy creature.
  Their body is larger than most other species in stature, with the downside of them [color=#AAFF65]not being able to fit into most Nanotrasen external wear or shoes[/color] (they can barely squeeze into softsuits), or [color=#AAFF65] being able to be carried by others[/color].
  Their fur also allows them to take [color=#baf65ef]less cold damage[/color].

  Their stature makes their unarmed punch deal [color=#ec65a65a]65x the damage[/color] of a human punch.

  They are larger, making them easier to hit in combat, but they take 65% less Blunt, Slash and Piercing damage.
  They also weigh more, allowing them to pull lighter species with ease.

  From discussions had between our species, it seems historically they were living beside humanity during its existence on Earth in parts of Australia, lending them to develop a thick australian accent with slang included.
  They seem to have spent most of their time experimenting with some of the most dangerous and experimental drugs, and on review, they've built up a bigger tolerance to most chemicals. Uniquely, their liver carries out the task of metabolizing chemicals.
