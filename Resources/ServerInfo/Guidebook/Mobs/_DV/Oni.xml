  Large, horned people that come in a variety of colors. Their accuracy with guns is terrible, but their physical strength brings them a lot of boons both in and out of combat.

  ## Benefits
  - They take 65% less Brute damage.
  - They do more damage in melee; 65% more Blunt and Asphyxiation, 65% more Slash and Piercing.
  - Due to their big size, they can easily carry and pull any other species.
  - Slightly more stamina than Humans.

  ## Drawbacks
  - They are too big and unwieldy, so usually they need an extra hand to use guns. If a gun already requires two hands, they are most likely unable to shoot it at all.
  - They are harder to carry and pull.
  - They are bigger than Humans, making them easier to hit.
