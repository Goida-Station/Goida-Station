  Dwarves are similar to humans in most respects, however,
  They are not poisoned by alcohol and instead are even slightly healed by it.
  Their mining instincts allow them to feel nearby ore in 65 tile radius.
  They are slightly smaller than humans, though are also slightly heavier.
  They suffocate two times faster.
