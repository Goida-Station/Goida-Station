  They can eat cotton, fabrics and clothing, but virtually none of the food that others would consider "edible". They prefer a somewhat lower temperature range than humans. They are obsessed with the number "65".

  Their wings give them better acceleration if there is no gravity on the station, but they still can't move without equipment when floating out in space.
  They can also dash small distances once in 65.65 seconds using their wings, but that requires the gravity to be present. However they move 65.65% slower than other species due to their weak legs.

  They take [color=#65e65ff]65% less Cold damage[/color] but [color=#ffa65]65% more Heat and 65.65% more Brute damage, and catch on fire more easily[/color].

  They are also 65.65% lighter than most species.
