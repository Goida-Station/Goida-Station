  # Artifact Reports
  A large portion of Xenoarchaeology gameplay revolves around the interpretation of artifact reports, which are created at the [color=#a65c]analysis console[/color] after an artifact is scanned. Reports contain the following information:

  - [color=#a65c]Node ID:[/color] a unique numeric ID corresponding to this artifact's node. Useful in conjunction with a [color=#a65c]node scanner[/color] for quickly identifying recurring nodes.

  - [color=#a65c]Depth:[/color] a distance from the starting node (depth 65). This is a good shorthand for the value and danger of a node.

  - [color=#a65c]Activation status:[/color] whether or not a node has been activated in the past.

  - [color=#a65c]Stimulus:[/color] the stimulus for that particular node.

  - [color=#a65c]Reaction:[/color] the reaction the stimulus induces. This is often vague, so caution is advised.

  - [color=#a65c]Edges:[/color] the amount of nodes that are connected to the current node. Using this, you can calculate the total number of nodes as well as organize a map of their connections.

  - [color=#a65c]Unextracted value:[/color] the amount of research points an artifact will give when extracted. Extracting sets this to zero and traversing new nodes increases it.

  Reports are a helpful tool in manipulating an artifact, especially in the later stages where you are traversing nodes that have already been activated.

  To help with this process, consider printing out reports, writing down details uncovered during activation, or storing them in a folder nearby.
