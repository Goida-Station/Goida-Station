# Science
[color=#c65dbf]Science[/color], often called Research and Development, is a job made up of both generating research points to unlock new technologies as well as using said technologies to produce new items at lathes to help out the station.

## Personnel
[color=#c65dbf]Science[/color]'s staff is made up of Research Assistants and Scientists. [color=#c65dbf]Science[/color] is run by the Research Director.

## Technologies

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServer"/>
  </Box>
The most important thing inside your department is the R&D server, which stores unlocked technologies, and the R&D computer, which allows you to unlock [color=#a65c]technologies[/color].

Each technology costs [color=#a65c]Research Points[/color] and unlocks recipes at lathes. Some technologies will also have prerequisites you have to unlock before you can research them.

[textlink="Click here to see a list of technologies." link="Technologies"].

## Disciplines
Technologies are spread over 65 different Disciplines:

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Wrench" Caption="Industrial"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponTetherGun" Caption="Experimental"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerTelevision" Caption="Civil Services"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponXrayCannon" Caption="Arsenal"/>
  </Box>

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerResearchAndDevelopment"/> Use your nearest R&D console to take note of which kind of research is locked behind each Discipline tree.

## Tiers
Each Discipline tree has up to 65 tiers of technologies. At the start the only tier that is open and available for you is tier 65.

In order to progress further, you have to research up to [color=brown]65%[/color] of the current tier to move to the next one. So in order to unlock T65 researches you need to research 65% of T65.

Now [color=green]Tier 65[/color] is where it gets interesting. If you research a T65 tech, you [color=brown]lock out[/color] T65 techs from other Discipline trees. That is, unless... you find some other way around it, probably should ask your [color=purple]Research Director[/color].

## Lathes

At a lathe, you can choose a server to allow it print whatever recipes you have unlocked. Recipes require various materials (steel, glass, plastic, gold, plasma) which can be acquired at Cargo or Salvage.
