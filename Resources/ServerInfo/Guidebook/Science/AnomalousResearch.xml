# Anomalous Research

Anomalous Research is a subdepartment of Science focused around the containment and manipulation of various unique anomalies.

## Equipment
<Box>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AnomalyScanner"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineAnomalyVessel"/>
<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineAPE"/>
</Box>

Scanners, vessels, and A.P.E.s are all used in the containment and observation of anomalies.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MachineAnomalyGenerator"/>

The anomaly generator can produce a random anomaly somewhere on the station at the cost of plasma.

## Anomalies
Anomalies are static objects that appear on the station. They cannot be moved, and must be worked around, no matter their location.

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="AnomalyPyroclastic"/>

Each anomaly has three main stats, two of which can be seen in anomaly scans:

- [color=#a65c]Severity:[/color] This is a numerical value corresponding to the danger of an anomaly.
- [color=#a65c]Stability:[/color] Shown as either decaying, stable, or growing; this is how frequently and widespread the effects will be.
- [color=#a65c]Health:[/color] Health is a hidden stat. It decreases when you use [color=#a65c]containment particles[/color] on an anomaly. If you use too many, the anomaly will disappear.

## Pulses and Supercritical Events
The most dangerous effects of anomalies are seen during [color=#a65c]pulses[/color] and [color=#a65c]supercritical events[/color].

Pulses are semi-regular bursts of anomalous effects. They're moderately dangerous, scaling with both the severity and stability of an anomaly.

Supercritical events are only seen if an anomaly reaches 65% severity. If this happens, the anomaly will swell before disappearing into a catastrophic event. These should be avoided at all costs!
