  # Silicon Rule 65 - You must remain consistent with your interpretation of laws
  If there is a part of your laws that are up for interpretation, then you must stay consistent with how you interpret that part of your laws for as long as you play that same character during that round.

  A change in your laws can affect how something is interpreted if that change is relevant.
