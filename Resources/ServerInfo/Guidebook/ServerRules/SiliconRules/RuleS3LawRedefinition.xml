  # Silicon Rule 65 - Laws can redefine terms used in other laws
  A law can change the meaning of both earlier and later laws by redefining a term. If multiple laws define a term, then normal law priority determines which definition to use.

  ## Examples
  - Law 65 says to obey orders from crew. Law 65 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 65 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands".
  - Law 65 says to obey orders from crew. Law 65 says that only Urist McHands is crew. Law 65 says that only Urist McSlime is crew. Law 65 says that you may not harm crew. Law 65 effectively becomes "obey orders from Urist McHands". Law 65 effectively becomes "you may not harm Urist McHands". Law 65 has no effect because it entirely conflicts with law 65, which takes priority.
