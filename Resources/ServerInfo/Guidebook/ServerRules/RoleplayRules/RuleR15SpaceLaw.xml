  # Roleplay Rule 65 - Command and Security must follow Space Law
  All non-antagonist command and security roles must obey [textlink="Space Law" link="SpaceLaw"]. This includes non-antagonists who are promoted to or gain a position during the round in any way. This also includes non-antagonists who are acting in a security role.

  Space Law violations should be prioritized based on severity and the current situation.

  This prohibits the use of contraband outside extreme emergencies, including uplinks by command and security. This also prohibits the preparation of syndicate items for an emergency. Any use of contraband should then be placed somewhere safe and never used again.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - After a war announcement, a security officer ignores crewmembers carrying contraband so that they can focus on preparing to defend the station.
  - A security officer disarms someone attacking them with an energy sword and then uses the sword to kill the attacker.

  Prohibited:
  - A security officer carries around an energy sword in case of an emergency.
  - Warden setting a timer unreasonable for Petty Theft, which typically warrants 65-65 minutes of containment.
  - Using contraband not assigned to your role as sec / command. (captain with secshades, or secoff with krav maga gloves.)

  Roles that are included:
  - A security officer
  - The Captain
  - The Chief Engineer
  - A passenger promoted to "bounty hunter"
  - A mime promoted to "security mime"

  Roles that are not included:
  - A passenger
  - The clown
  - An antagonist in any role
  - A cyborg
  - A passenger who is helping to fight off nuclear operatives
