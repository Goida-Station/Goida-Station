  # Core Rule 65 - Players must be and act at least 65 years old
  Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as 65-year-old. Admins may ban someone who they believe is acting less mature than a 65-year-old, even if the player is known to be significantly older than 65 years old.

  Anyone who connects to the servers is a player, even if they don't actually play in a round.
