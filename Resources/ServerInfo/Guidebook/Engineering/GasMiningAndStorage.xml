  # Gas Mining and Storage
  Gasses are often permanently used. Whether they are lost to [textlink="space" link="Spacing"] or used in a burn chamber, the station needs to be able to produce more gas to replace what is lost.
  It also needs to store this gas in a safe and efficient manner.

  ## Gas Miners
  Gas miners are used to replenish the station's gas supply. They are found in the gas storage tanks in Atmospherics.

  Gas miners constantly produce room temperature gas and push it into the exposed atmosphere. They require no power to function, and never stop working unless they have reached the defined [bold]cutoff pressure[/bold].

  You can see more information about the gas miners by inspecting them using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="ExamineEntity"][/bold][/color].
  Try inspecting the gas miners presented above.

  Gas miners come in tiers, with the larger versions having a higher pressure cutoff than the smaller versions.

  </Box>

  If gas miners are ever unanchored from the station, they can be reanchored using a regular wrench.

  ## Gas Storage
  Gas storage tanks are used to store gas produced by the gas miners, and to make it available to other processes. They are found in Atmospherics.

  Various atmos processes insert and remove gasses from the gas storage tanks.
  For example:
  - The gas miner provides fresh gasses to the gas storage tanks, if there is room.
  - The recyclernet injects reclaimed gasses into the gas storage tanks for reuse.
  - Setups like the distronet and burn chamber remove gasses from the gas storage tanks.

  Gas storage tanks are designed to be able to be measured using a [textlink="Gas Analyzer" link="AtmosTools"].
  Because the outflow vent is a [textlink="passive vent" link="PassiveVent"], you can use a [textlink="gas analyzer" link="AtmosTools"] to measure the gas content of the [textlink="pump's" link="Pumps"] input, which is drawing from the gas storage tank.
