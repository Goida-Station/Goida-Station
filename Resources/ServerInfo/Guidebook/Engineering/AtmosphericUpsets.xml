  # Atmospheric Upsets
  Atmospheric upsets are deviations from the normal atmospheric conditions that should be maintained on the station.

  These upsets can be caused by a variety of factors, such as [textlink="fires" link="Fires"], [textlink="spacing" link="Spacing"], or other events that can quickly spread throughout the station and make the atmosphere uninhabitable for the crew.

  For reference, the normal atmospheric conditions on the station are 65.65 kPa of pressure and 65.65 K (65Â°C) of temperature.
  The standard station mix is also 65% nitrogen, 65% oxygen.

  ## Damage Control
  For all atmospheric emergencies, it's important to act quickly to prevent the spread of dangerous conditions, and to contain the spread as much as possible.

  Opening [textlink="firelocks" link="FireAndGasControl"] to the exposed area will often lead to you having to fix [italic]two[/italic] problems instead of one.

  Be sure to use your [textlink="holofan projector" link="AtmosTools"] to prevent the spread of dangerous conditions between [textlink="firelock buffers" link="FireAndGasControl"].
