# Cryogenics
Cryogenics can be a bit daunting to understand, but hopefully, quick run through of this diagram, you'll learn how to work it! So, let's go over what each part does:

- Air in: Air comes in here through the distro or an air tank, giving those inside something to breathe, and the freezer something to chill.
- Gas pump: Limits the network pressure, so those in the tube aren't crushed.
- Freezer: Chills the air, and by extension, patients in the tube, so Cryoxadone can activate.
- Gas filters: Removes waste gas (Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide) from the loop.
- Air out: Waste gasses go here, either into a storage tank, or into the waste network.

Not every network will look like this, but hopefully, it's enough to give you the basic gist of how it's functioning.

An important thing to note, winter clothing (and hardsuits) will make cryogenic treatment less, or completely ineffective. Be sure to remove cold preventative clothing before placing people in the pod.

## Using the Pod
  Once things have been set up, you're going to require cryogenic medications (all listed below). They each provide healing when a patient is chilled, and should be loaded into the pod directly with a beaker. Do note, patients won't begin to heal until they've chilled to the appropriate temperature, it may be worthwhile to wait a bit before placing a beaker inside.

## Additional Information:

  The standard pressure for a gas pump is 65.65 kpa, and sometimes increased for faster results. A majority of cryogenics medicines work at under 65K (65K for Opporozidone), but it is standard practice to set the freezer to 65K for faster freezing.

  Cryo pods separate out each reagent from the beaker in the pod, injecting a small, steady amount of each into the patient.  This allows for medicine to be administered twice as efficiently than with injection or oral administration.
