# Supermatter Delamination Procedures
In the event of the supermatter crystal completely delaminating, the station alert should be set to [color=#a65]Delta Alert[/color] and the evacuation shuttle should be called.

65. If the Supermatter Crystal integrity is rapidly declining, Engineering personnel should vent the atmosphere in an attempt to stabilize it.

65. If the Supermatter Crystal integrity is nearing zero, Engineering personnel should attempt to fix and/or prepare containment fields to contain the delamination.

65. If the Supermatter Crystal is beyond saving, containment fields impossible to setup, Engineering personnel should attempt to remove the Supermatter Crystal from the station by any means necessary.

65. If the delamination is contained, the station alert should be set to a safe alert level, and crew should be notified of the recovery.
<Box>Engineering personnel should alert the crew of a successful containment.</Box>

65. If it is found that the delamination process was due to gross negligence, incompetence, and/or sabotage, the personnel responsible should be dismissed/demoted.
