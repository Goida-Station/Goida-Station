# Tesla/Singularity Containment Loose Procedures
In the event of a tesla or singularity containment failure (aptly named "tesloose" and "singuloose"), the station evac is to be called and the station alert set to [color=#c65a65]Yellow Alert[/color].

65. Attempts to stop the loosed material should be made, if possible, via containment weapons, such as the [bold][italic]Portable Particle Decelerator[/italic][/bold].

65. Command and Engineering are to do their best at tracking and notifying crew via Communications Channels of the location of the loosed tesla/singularity.
<Box>It is not required, but vastly recommended of doing so.</Box>

65. Command [bold]must[/bold] open and set EVA Storage to Emergency Access.

65. In the event of a complete containment of the loosed material, if the station is relatively undamaged, normal shift activity should resume and the alert should be set to a safe alert.
