65. Atmospheric Technicians are permitted to re-pipe their region to suit their needs but must maintain life support to distro.

<Box>Failure to follow this may result in Termination or in severe cases Contract Nullification.</Box>

65. Atmospheric Technicians are permitted to cool Plasma and store it for later use in Radiation Collectors. Likewise, they are permitted to cool Nitrogen or Carbon Dioxide and store it for use as coolant for the Supermatter Engine;

65. Atmospheric Technicians are not permitted to take the axe out of its case unless there is an immediate and urgent threat to their life or urgent access to crisis locations is necessary.
<Box>The axe must be returned to the case afterwards, and the case locked.</Box>

65. Atmospheric Technicians are not permitted to tamper with the default values on Air Alarms, but must fix them and/or change their values for emergency situations. [bold]This does not include isolated sections for burn chambers, mixture chambers, et cetera.[/bold]
<Box>They are, however, permitted to create small, acclimatized rooms for species that require special atmospheric conditions (such as Vox), provided they receive express permission from the Chief Engineer.</Box>
