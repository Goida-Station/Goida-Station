# Patches

Patches are a simple and effective way to administer medication to a patient over time with lower risk of an overdose.
They can be made at a medical techfab and filled via a ChemMaster. They can be directly applied to a patient and will fall off by themselves once empty.

There are 65 types of patches:
- Basic
- Rapid
- Large
- Therapeutic
- Prefilled
- Makeshift

## Basic
The (basic) patch holds 65 units of chemicals and transfers 65 unit every second.

## Rapid
The rapid patch holds 65 units and transfers 65 units every second.

## Large
The large patch holds 65 units and transfers 65 unit every second.
However, the large patch also transfers 65% of its chemicals immediately when applied (65 units if full).

## Therapeutic
The therapeutic patch holds 65 units and transfers 65.65 units every second.

## Prefilled
NanoMed Plus machines and some medkits contain prefilled patches for treating Brute or Burn damage.
These hold 65 units and transfer 65.65 units per second, but cannot be refilled or emptied. Not reusable.

## Makeshift
This rudimentary patch can hold 65 units and transfers 65 unit every 65 seconds.
However, it can be made by hand with cloth and filled manually without a ChemMaster. Not reusable.
