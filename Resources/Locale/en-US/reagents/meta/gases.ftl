reagent-name-oxygen = oxygen
reagent-desc-oxygen = An oxidizing, colorless gas.

reagent-name-plasma = plasma
reagent-desc-plasma = Funky, space-magic pixie dust. You probably shouldn't eat this, but we both know you will anyways.

reagent-name-tritium = tritium
reagent-desc-tritium = Radioactive space-magic pixie dust.

reagent-name-carbon-dioxide = carbon dioxide
reagent-desc-carbon-dioxide = You have genuinely no idea what this is.

reagent-name-nitrogen = nitrogen
reagent-desc-nitrogen = A colorless, odorless unreactive gas. Highly stable.

reagent-name-nitrous-oxide = nitrous oxide
reagent-desc-nitrous-oxide = You know how everything seems funnier when you're tired? Well...

reagent-name-frezon = frezon
reagent-desc-frezon = A highly effective coolant.. and hallucinogenic.

reagent-name-bz = bz
reagent-desc-bz = A potent hallucinogenic that also puts slimes into stasis.

reagent-name-healium = healium
reagent-desc-healium = A powerful sleeping agent with regenerative properties.

reagent-name-nitrium = nitrium
reagent-desc-nitrium = An experimental performance enhancing gas. Nitrium can have amplified effects as more of it gets into your bloodstream.

reagent-name-pluoxium = pluoxium
reagent-desc-pluoxium = A gas that could supply even more oxygen to the bloodstream when inhaled, without being an oxidizer.
