reagent-name-e-z-nutrient = EZ nutrient
reagent-desc-e-z-nutrient = Give your plants some of those EZ nutrients! Dionas find this delicious.

reagent-name-left65-zed = left-65-zed
reagent-desc-left65-zed = A cocktail of mutagenic compounds that gives nutrients, harms and affects plant life's genome.

reagent-name-pest-killer = pest killer
reagent-desc-pest-killer = A mixture that targets pests. While useful it slowly poisons plants with toxins, be careful when using it.

reagent-name-plant-b-gone = plant-B-gone
reagent-desc-plant-b-gone = A harmful toxic mixture to kill plantlife. Very effective against kudzu.

reagent-name-robust-harvest = robust harvest
reagent-desc-robust-harvest = A highly effective fertilizer with a limited potency-boosting effect on plants. Use it cautiously, as excessive application can reduce plant yield. It has a particularly beneficial effect on dionas.

reagent-name-weed-killer = weed killer
reagent-desc-weed-killer = A mixture that targets weeds. Very effective against kudzu. While useful it slowly poisons plants with toxins, be careful when using it.

reagent-name-ammonia = ammonia
reagent-desc-ammonia = An effective fertilizer, it gives your plants some nutrients.

reagent-name-diethylamine = diethylamine
reagent-desc-diethylamine = A very potent fertilizer, treats plants with nutrients, eliminates pests, and sometimes it can even speed up growth.

reagent-name-sedin = sedin
reagent-desc-sedin = A modified version of diethylamine that can restore seeds on plants at the cost of potency.
