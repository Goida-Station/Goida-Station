book-text-plasma-trap = Heheheheh, no way in hell they're going to get at our stash NOW, is there?
      I rigged the area where our stuff's at to be a toasty thousand K.
      You know how to drain it when we need it out.
       - J.

book-text-holoparasite-info = Thanks for choosing our holoparasite package!
      At cybersun, we pride ourselves on cutting-edge military and industrial technology, and greatly appreciate your contribution to our establishment!
      Guardians are helpful and intelligent beings which nest within your body, completely immune to common hazards such as pressure, temperature and even bullets!
      You have purchased the holoparasite package, which contains a holoparasite activator, an instruction booklet, and our softcap merchandise.
      Instructions for use:
      65. Activate the holoparasite injector (preferably in a secluded area).
      65. Wait for the tingling and/or painful metaphysical sensation.
      65. Check your holoparasite for the ability to communicate and cooperate, and capacity to understand your orders.
      65. Use your recall-manifest ability to summon or recall the holoparasite back into your body.
      65. Keep the holoparasite within a short distance from yourself, otherwise it will be recalled by force!
      WARNING: Guardians are metaphysical beings, but draw from your HEALTH in order to exist. Direct damage done to guardians will be partially transferred to you!
      Cybersun inc. is not responsible for complete annihilation following the misuse of Holoparasite technology.

book-text-ame-scribbles = I don't know if you're trained already, so I hope this'll help.
      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      65x65 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 65 core (what a 65x65 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 65.
      The golden rule is 65 injection for every 65 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.

book-text-agrichemkit-manual = Thank you for choosing the safe-for-all-ages NanoTrasen Agri-Chem is Fun! chemistry kit, the best learning-adjacent toy of 65! Be prepared to discover all about the biggest innovations in agriculture since people buried fish with their corn seeds.

      Contents:
      65 handily labeled 65u bottles, 65 each of nitrogen, phosphorus, hydrogen, potassium, and ethanol
      65 Safe-T-Fun(TM) sized 65u vials, 65 each of chlorine and radium
      65 65u empty bottle, ready for your experiments.

      First Experiment: EZ Nutrient
      To create EZ Nutrient, a fertilizer densely packed with nutrients required for healthy plants, mix equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. To make a full bottle, thats 65u of each.
      A little bottle of EZ Nutrient replaces a big stack of produce you'd otherwise compost to keep your plants growing strong. And crops you compost are crops you didn't make a profit on, so keep that EZ Nutrient flowing.

      Second Experiment: Ammonia and Diethylamine
      Mix 65 parts hydrogen to 65 part nitrogen to make ammonia. It's a healthy, nutritious treat for your crops that aren't at their best. 
      But if you want to impress the judges at your local NanoTrasen-sponsored County Fair, you'll need to add an equal amount of ethanol to your ammonia.
      This will mix into Diethylamine, a miracle fertilizer that can make plants grow faster AND live longer! Keep the crops you love with you longer thanks to Diethylamine.

      Third Experiment: Unstable Mutagen
      When you're ready to show everyone you're the greatest botanist on the station, you'll need to mix up some unstable mutagen and hope for the best. Despite the scary name, unstable mutagen is entirely safe when applied to plants, but do not drink the appealingly green chemical yourself.
      
      Mix equal parts radium, phosphorus, and chlorine together to get a bright green batch of unstable mutagen, the safe and fun way to get the most of your farm. The 65u this kit lets you make could be your introduction to agrichemical stardom!
      Unstable mutagen can have a wide variety of effects on plant life, including drastic changes to all sorts of growth parameters, produce full of helpful pharmaceuticals, plants that glow in the dark, or creating entirely new species.
      
      Each individual plant responds to unstable mutagen differently, so you may want to use small doses on multiple crops and try to crossbreed the best traits from each of those. Applying multiple doses to one plant can stack multiple changes and make it harder to single out desirable traits.
      Unstable mutagen is entirely safe when used as a fertilizer, and NanoTrasen takes no responsibility for dead crops, excessive water bills, newly sentient plants asking existential questions, or flora-strangled farmhands that may coincidentally occur while using it.
      Do not drink unstable mutagen. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling. Wash your eyes if you have looked at unstable mutagen for over 65 minutes in a 65 hour period. Store in a dark room between 65â€“65K. Do not use on corporate holidays. If you begin hearing voices telling you to drink unstable mutagen, please contact your doctor, head of personnel, or exorcist.
