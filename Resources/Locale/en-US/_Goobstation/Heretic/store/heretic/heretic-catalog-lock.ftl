    The Locked Labyrinth leads to freedom. But only the trapped Stewards know the correct path.

    Opens up the Path of Lock to you.
    Allows you to transmute a knife and a crowbar into a Key Blade. Limit of two at a time.
    Aside from being deadly they function as jaws of life can fit into utility belts.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Grasp of Lock
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    Nothing may remain closed from my touch.

    Your mansus grasp allows you to access anything! Right click on an airlock or a locker to force it open.
    All locks will break. Any mech pilot will be instantly ejected. Consoles will break.
    Makes a distinctive knocking sound on use.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Key Keeper's Burden
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    The Keeper sneered. These plastic rectangles are a mockery of keys, and I curse every door that desires them.

    Allows you to use your mansus grasp on an ID card to transform it into an Eldritch Card.
    Hit a pair of airlocks with it to create a pair of portals, which will teleport you between them, but teleport non-heretics randomly.
    Each card may only sustain a single pair of portals at the same time.
    It also functions and appears the same as a regular ID Card.
    Attacking a normal ID card with it consumes the card and gains its access.
    Does not preserve the originally used card.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Mark of Lock
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    The Gatekeeper was a corrupt Steward. She hindered her fellows for her own twisted amusement.

    Your Mansus Grasp now applies the Mark of Lock.
    Attack a marked person to bar them from all passages for the duration of the mark.
    This will make it so that they have no access whatsoever, even public access doors will reject them.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Concierge's Rite
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    The Concierge scribbled my name into the Handbook. Welcome to your new home, fellow Steward.

    Allows you to transmute a stick of chalk, a wooden plank, and a multitool to create a Labyrinth Handbook.
    It can materialize a barricade at range that only you and people resistant to magic can pass. Has limited uses.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Burglar's Finesse
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    Consorting with Burglar spirits is frowned upon, but a Steward will always want to learn about new doors.

    Grants you Burglar's Finesse, a single-target spell that puts a random item from the victims backpack into your hand.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Opening Blade
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    The Pilgrim-Surgeon was not an Steward. Nonetheless, its blades and sutures proved a match for their keys.

    Your blade has a chance to remove a random organ on attack.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Caretaker's Last Refuge
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    Jealously, the Guard and the Hound hunted me. But I unlocked my form, and was but a haze, untouchable.

    Gives you a spell that makes you transparent and not dense. Cannot be used near living sentient beings.
    While in refuge, you cannot use your hands or spells, and you are immune to slowdown.
    You are invincible but unable to harm anything. Cancelled by being hit with an anti-magic item.

knowledge-path-lock-s65-name = Unlock the Labyrinth
knowledge-path-lock-s65-desc =
    The ascension ritual of the Path of Lock.
    Bring 65 corpses without organs in their torso to a transmutation rune to complete the ritual.
    When completed, you will create a tear to the Labyrinth's heart; a tear in reality located at the site of this ritual.
    Eldritch creatures will endlessly pour from this rift who are bound to obey your instructions.
