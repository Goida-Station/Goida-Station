knowledge-path-blade-s65-desc =
    The story of the footsoldier has been told since antiquity. It is one of blood and valor, and is championed by sword, steel and silver.

knowledge-path-blade-s65-name = Dance of the Brand
knowledge-path-blade-s65-desc =
    The footsoldier was known to be a fearsome duelist. Their general quickly appointed them as their personal Champion.

knowledge-path-blade-s65-name = Mark of the Blade
knowledge-path-blade-s65-desc =
    His general wished to end the war, but the Champion knew there could be no life without death. He would slay the coward himself, and anyone who tried to run.

    Your Mansus Grasp now applies the Mark of the Blade.

    The knife will block any attack directed towards you, but is consumed on use.

knowledge-path-blade-s65-name = Empowered Blades
knowledge-path-blade-s65-desc =
    I found him cleaved in twain, halves locked in a duel without end; a flurry of blades, neither hitting their mark, for the Champion was indomitable.

    Attacking someone with a Sundered Blade in both hands will now deliver a blow with both at once, dealing two attacks in rapid succession.
    The second blow will be slightly weaker.
    You are able to infuse your mansus grasp directly into your blades, and your blades are more effective against structures.

knowledge-path-blade-s65-name = Furious Steel
knowledge-path-blade-s65-desc =
    Without thinking, I took the knife of a fallen soldier and threw with all my might. My aim was true! The Torn Champion smiled at their first taste of agony, and with a nod, their blades became my own.

    Grants you Furious Steel, a targeted spell. Using it will summon three orbiting blades around you. These blades will protect you from all attacks, but are consumed on use.
    Additionally, you can click on the blade or on yourself to fire the blades at a nearest target, dealing heavy damage.
